# Tier 1 Repos

A tier 1 repo is a repo which requires the dependency flow and composition that is provided by Arcade.  Tier 1 repos fully participate in all shared tooling and infrastructure areas.
The primary driving business requirement is the ability to build .NET Core 3 transparently, quickly, reliably, and in a serviceable form.
